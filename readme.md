This a C code that helps you create a bingo board of any size.\
It also has a built in algorithm to figure out the next best number to pick in your turn.

The way it does is it counts the number of cells in a row, column or diagonal(all 3 has separate counts) that are crossed out, and suggests the cells that increases the count the most when pressed.
